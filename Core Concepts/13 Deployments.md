- How do we deploy in prod?
- We need not one, but many instances of our app running.
- Also, whenever a new build of our app is in our registry, we want to upgrade our nodes seamlessly.
- However, we don't want to upgrade all at once, this may impact users. We wanna do **rolling updates**.
- We also would like to be able to **rollback** breaking changes.
- Finally, if we would like to make multiple changes, we don't wanna apply each change immediately - you would like to apply a **pause, make the changes, and then resume**, so that all the changes are rolled out together.![[Pasted image 20250317195415.png]]
- This is available with **Deployments**. Our apps are running in containers, these run in PODs, these are managed by ReplicaSets, and the **final layer is a Deployment**, which allows us to do all of the above seamlessly:

- How do we create a Deployment? With a definition file!
- The deployment file is identical to the **ReplicaSet** file, except for `kind: Deployment`. 
- `kubectl create -f deployment-definition.yaml`
- `kubectl get deployments`
- `kubectl get replicaset` will show you the automatically created ReplicaSets by the deployment.
- `kubectl get all` to see **all objects.**
