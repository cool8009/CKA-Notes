- Securing your Kubernetes cluster with TLS might seem challenging if you're not already familiar with TLS certificates. In developing this course, we surveyed our audience and discovered that many of you felt uncomfortable or had limited knowledge about TLS certificates. To address this, we’ve created a series of lessons designed to help you understand and manage certificates within Kubernetes—and beyond.

If you already have a solid understanding of TLS certificates, feel free to skip directly to the Kubernetes-specific sections. By the end of this article, you will be equipped with the skills to efficiently configure, monitor, and troubleshoot certificate-related issues in your Kubernetes environment, while also gaining a broader understanding of how TLS certificates work overall. Mastering these concepts will enhance your ability to secure and maintain robust infrastructures.

We begin with the fundamentals of certificates, covering key concepts such as certificate authorities, issuance, and validation processes. If these basics are already within your grasp, you may proceed to the next section where we delve deeper into managing certificates specifically in Kubernetes.

Note

For best results, it is recommended to review the foundational lessons on certificate management before tackling the Kubernetes-specific content.
